# 01_Horiseon_Optimization

This project required that the source code in index.html and style.css be changed to accomplish the following goals (pasted from original instructions for assignment): 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Actions

In order to satisfy the acceptance criteria, I did the following: 

1. Turned most of the div's into semantic HTML (main, aside, footer)
2. Re-organized style.css so that it aligned with the order in which HTML elements appeared in index.html
3. Condensed the CSS so that the elements within main, aside, etc. had the same properties without using redundant code
4. Added ALT attributes to images
5. Made h tags sequential 
6. Modified title
7. I utilized the command line tools with Github to upload my project and make it live
